## What is Organizator?

Organizator is an open-source Flutter app for Android that keeps track of records with an
expiry date and warns you, and your clients, before they expire. It also runs an SMS booking
bot: clients book or cancel an appointment by text message, and the booking appears in the app.
Everything runs on the phone, with no server and no internet connection.

Insurance agents use it for policy renewals. Firms use it for contracts and subscriptions.
Salons, clinics and workshops use it for appointments booked by SMS.

---

## Features

- **Records with expiry dates**, each with up to 3 phone numbers, organised in up to 10 tables
- **Local alerts** before and at expiry
- **SMS reminders** to clients, with an editable message template
- **SMS self-booking per category and service:** a client sends `liber unghii`, picks a service
  from the list, then a free slot. Each service has its own duration, and the free slots are
  computed from it.
- **Cancellation by SMS**: the client sends `anuleaza`. This works for SMS bookings and for
  bookings added by hand.
- **No-show tracking:** you confirm whether the client came after the appointment. No-shows show
  up as red dots next to the client, and from a threshold you choose, the bot stops accepting
  SMS bookings from that client.
- **Bot abuse limits**, with a per-number hourly limit, a daily reply limit and a maximum number
  of active bookings per client
- **Two-phone sync over SMS**, with messages signed by a pairing code entered on both phones
- **Encrypted backup**, daily and manual, to phone storage or a USB stick
- **Reports** for any period
- 30-day free trial, then an activation license (see [Free Trial & Activation License](#free-trial--activation-license))

## How It Works

```
Client texts "liber unghii"   →  bot replies with the services
Client replies with a number  →  bot replies with the free slots
Client replies with a number  →  booking saved in the table, reminder scheduled
```

The SMS bot runs natively on Android (a `BroadcastReceiver`), so it answers even when the
app is closed. Sync messages between the two phones are authenticated with the pairing code,
and the bot only answers phone numbers.

## Free Trial & Activation License

The complete source code, including the 30-day trial check, is published here under the AGPL-3.0.
**The code is not sold**, and the rights the AGPL gives you (to use, study, modify and redistribute it)
don't depend on buying anything.

What is sold is an **activation license**: a signed file, tied to one install code (Business ID),
that unlocks the app after the 30-day free trial in the Organizator app distributed by Volt Academy
(the Android APK available at [voltacademy.app/organizator.html](https://voltacademy.app/organizator.html)).

| Period | Requirement |
|---|---|
| First 30 days after install | Free, all features |
| After the trial | Activation license — 30, 60 or 180 days, or permanent |

Licenses are bought at [voltacademy.app/organizator.html](https://voltacademy.app/organizator.html#licentiere),
where current prices are listed. Expirable licenses bought for the same install code add up, and the
license becomes permanent automatically once their total reaches the price of a permanent license.

To activate a license:

1. Open the **Licență** screen in the app and copy your install code.
2. Buy a license on the site with that code and download `organizator_license.json`.
3. Back on the **Licență** screen, tap **Selectează fișierul de licență** and pick the downloaded file.

One license covers two synced phones. Once sync is set up, tap **Trimite licența la telefonul partener**
and the license is sent over SMS to the second phone.
